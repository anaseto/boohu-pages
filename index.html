<h1>Break Out Of Hareka's Underground (Boohu)</h1>
<p>
Break Out Of Hareka's Underground (Boohu) is a roguelike game mainly inspired
from <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/download.htm">DCSS</a> and its tavern,
with some ideas from <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">Brogue</a>, but aiming for
very short games, almost no character building, and a simplified inventory.
</p>
<p>
<i>Every year, the elders send someone to collect medicinal simella plants in the
Underground.  This year, the honor fell upon you, and so here you are.
According to the elders, deep in the Underground, magical stairs will lead you
back to your village.  Along the way, you will collect simellas, as well as
various items that will help you deal with monsters, which you may
fight or flee...</i>

<h2>Basic Survival Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Position yourself to fight one enemy at a time whenever possible.</li>
<li>Fight far enough from unknown terrain if you can: combat is noisy, more
monsters will come if they hear it.</li>
<li>Use your potions, projectiles and rods. With experience you learn when you
can spare them, and when you should use them, but dying with a potion of heal
wounds in the inventory should never be a thing.</li>
<li>Avoid dead-ends if you do not have any means of escape, such as potions of
teleportation, unless no better options are available.</li>
<li>You do not have to kill every monster. You want, though, to find as many items
as you can, but survival comes first.</li>
<li>Use doors and dense foliage to break line of sight with monsters.</li>
</ul>
