<h1>Break Out of Hareka's Underground (Boohu)</h1>
<p>Break Out Of Hareka's Underground (Boohu) is a roguelike game that
takes inspiration mainly from DCSS and its tavern, and some ideas from Brogue,
but aiming for very short games, almost no character building, and simplified
inventory management.</p>
<p>Every year, your village sends someone to collect medicinal simella plants
in the Underground. This year, the duty fell upon you, and so here you are.
Your heart is torn between your will to be as helpful as possible to your
village and your will to make it out alive. Deep in the Underground, some
magical stairs will lead you back to your village. Along the way, you will
collect simellas, as well as various helpful items. You will also encounter
monsters, fight against them, or run away from them when you canâ€¦</p>
